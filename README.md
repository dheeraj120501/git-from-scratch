# GIT from Scratch

This is a simple git implementation made using the following resources

- [Write yourself a git](https://wyag.thb.lt/)
- [Build your own git](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x#build-your-own-git)

I also documented my learning and some other resources [here](https://dheeraj120501.notion.site/Build-your-own-Git-13d94a5a1082416091f38ac9f3c49797?pvs=4).

## Note for Windows users

`mygit` should run on any Unix-like system with node installed. The test suite absolutely requires a bash-compatible shell, which I assume the WSL can provide for windows user. Also, if you are using WSL, make sure your `mygit` file uses Unix-style line endings ([Solution for VS Code](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48692741/how-can-i-make-all-line-endings-eols-in-all-files-in-visual-studio-code-unix)).
